# PLACES-YOU'VE-BEEN.

## Description OF Program.

This program is **a book or a database used for storing entries i.e places you've visited.**. Each entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: location, landmark, period, notes). It allows users to store details of their travels and tours.

## PROGRAM SETUP INSTRUCTIONS && TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENTS {TDD}.

### SETUP:

- Use index.html for home page.
- Used css to style pages (custom styles.css as well as bootstrap).
- Sent valid commits regularly through Github.
- I used javascript to make the page interactive (custom javascript and Jquery)
- And i finally used VS code edittor to add a READme.

### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENTS {TDD}:


-----> Describe: Visited()

* Test: It is a constructive function, it takes the visit details and stores them as an object.

* Code: let newTour = new Visited("location", "landmark", "season", "notes");  console.log(newTour);

* Expected Output: VisitedÂ {location: "location", landmark: "landmark", period: "period", notes: "notes"}

-----> Describe Visited.prototype.location()

* Test: It is a prototypal function under the Visited Constructor which takes the tour location and returns it.

* Code: newTour.location();

* Expected Output: "location"


-----> Describe: PlacesVisited()

* Description: This is a constructive function which stores all Visited in an object, in this case it was used to mock a database it behaves similarly as a database would. It has just two parameters in it({visits = {}; currentId = 0;}).  It has prototypal functions assigned to it(addVisit, assignId, findVisit, deleteVisit) which would be used to add a visit, assign id to a particular visit, find a visit, and delete a visit respectively.
